\begin{abstract}
For decades, analog magnetic tape recording was the most popular
method for recording music, but has been replaced over the past 30 years first by
DAT tape, then by DAWs and audio interfaces \cite{Kadis}. Despite being replaced
by higher quality technology, many have sought to recreate a "tape" sound
through digital effects, despite the distortion, tape "hiss", and other
oddities analog tape produced. The following paper describes the general process
of creating a physical model of an analog tape machine starting from basic
physical principles, then discusses in-depth a real-time implementation
of a physical model of a Sony TC-260 tape machine.
\newline\newline
"Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable, and nasty
about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness
of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished
and emulated as soon as they can be avoided." -Brian Eno \cite{Eno}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Continuous Time System}
Audio recorded to and played back from a tape machine can be thought of as going
through three distinct processors: the record head, tape magnetisation, and the play
head.

\subsection{The Record Head}
For an instantaneous input current $I(t)$, the magnetic field output of the record 
head is given as a function of distance along the tape ($x$), and depth into 
the tape ($y$). Using the Karlqvist medium field approximation, we find
\cite{1994tmr..book.....B}:

\begin{multline}
    H_x(x,y) = \frac{1}{\pi} H_0 \Big(\tan^{-1} \Big(\frac{(g/2) + x}{y} \Big) \\
    + \tan^{-1} \Big(\frac{(g/2) - x}{y} \Big) \Big)
    \label{eq:H_x}
\end{multline}
\begin{equation}
    H_y(x,y) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} H_0 \ln \Big(\frac{((g/2) - x)^2 + y^2}{((g/2) + x)^2 + y^2} \Big)
    \label{eq:H_y}
\end{equation}
%
where $g$ is the head gap, and $H_0$ is the deep gap field, given by:

\begin{equation}
    H_0 = \frac{NEI}{g}
\end{equation}
%
where $N$ is the number of turns coils of wire around the head, and $E$ is the head 
efficiency which can be calculated by:

\begin{equation}
    E = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{l  A_g}{\mu_r g} \int_{core} \frac {d \vec{l}}{A(l)}}
\end{equation}
%
where $A_g$ is the gap area, $\mu_r$ is the core permeability relative to 
free space ($\mu_0$), and $A(l)$ is the cross-sectional 
area of the core as a function of length.

\subsection{Tape Magnetisation}
The magnetic field being recorded to tape can be described using 
a hysteresis loop, as follows \cite{1994tmr..book.....B}:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{M}(x,y) = F_{Loop}(\vec{H}(x,y))
\end{equation}
%
where $F_{Loop}$ is a generalized hysteresis function.
\newline\newline
Using the Jiles-Atherton magnetisation model, the following
differential equation describes magnetisation ($M$) as a function 
of magnetic field ($H$) \cite{Hysteresis}:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{dM}{dH} = \frac{(1-c) \delta_M (M_{an} - M)}{(1-c) \delta k - \alpha (M_{an} - M)} + c \frac{dM_{an}}{dH}
    \label{eq5}
\end{equation}
%
where $c$ is the ratio of normal and anhysteric initial susceptibilities,
$k$ is a measure of the width of the hysteresis
loop, $\alpha$ is a mean field parameter, representing inter-domain
coupling, and $\delta$ and $\delta_M$ are given by:

\begin{equation}
    \delta = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if H is increasing} \\
        -1 & \text{if H is decreasing}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \delta_M = \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if $\delta$ and $M_{an} - M$ have the same sign} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
$M_{an}$ is the anisotropic magnetisation given by:

\begin{equation}
    M_{an} = M_s L \Big( \frac{H + \alpha M}{a} \Big)
\end{equation}
%
where $M_s$ is the magnetisation saturation, $a$ characterizes the shape
of the anhysteric magnetisation and $L$ is the Langevin function:

\begin{equation}
    L(x) = \coth (x) - \frac{1}{x}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Play Head}
\subsubsection{Ideal Playback Voltage}
The ideal playback voltage as a function of tape magnetisation is given by
\cite{1994tmr..book.....B}:

\begin{equation}
    V(x) =  NWEv \mu_0 \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx' \int_{-\delta/2}^{\delta/2} dy' \vec{h}(x' + x, y') \cdot \frac{\vec{M}(x', y')}{dx}
    \label{eq:Vx}
\end{equation}
%
where $N$ is the number of turns of wire, $W$ is the width of the playhead, $E$ is the playhead
efficiency, $v$ is the tape speed, and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.
Note that $V(x) = V(vt)$ for constant $v$. $\vec{h}(x, y)$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{h} (x, y) \equiv \frac{\vec{H} (x, y)}{NIE}
    \label{eq12}
\end{equation}
%
where $\vec{H} (x, y)$ can be calculated by \cref{eq:H_x,eq:H_y}.

\subsubsection{Loss Effects}
There are several frequency-dependent loss effects associated with playback,
described as follows \cite{Kadis}:

\begin{equation}
    V(t) = V_0(t) [e^{-kd}] \Big[\frac{1 - e^{-k \delta}}{k \delta} \Big] \Big[\frac{\sin (kg /2)}{kg/2} \Big]
    \label{eq:lossEffects}
\end{equation}
%
for sinusoidal input $V_0(t)$, where $k$ is the wave number, $d$ is the distance between the tape and the playhead,
$g$ is the gap width of the play head, and $\delta$ is the thickness of the tape. The wave number
is given by:

\begin{equation}
    k = \frac {2 \pi f}{v}
    \label{eq:wavenumber}
\end{equation}
%
where $f$ is the frequency and $v$ is the tape speed.

\section{Digitizing the System}
\subsection{Record Head}
For simplicity, let us assume,
\begin{equation}
    \vec{H}(x,y,t) = \vec{H}(0,0,t)
    \label{eq:spatialApprox}
\end{equation}
%
In this case $H_y \equiv 0$, and $H_x \equiv H_0$. Thus,
\begin{equation}
    H(t) = \frac{NEI(t)}{g}
    \label{eq15}
\end{equation}
%
or,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}(n) = \frac{NE\hat{I}(n)}{g}
    \label{eq:Hin}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Hysteresis}
Beginning from \cref{eq5}, we can find the derivative of $M$ w.r.t. time,
as in \cite{Hysteresis}:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dM}{dt} = \frac{\frac{(1-c) \delta_M (M_sL(Q) - M)}{(1-c) \delta k - \alpha (M_sL(Q) - M)} \frac{dH}{dt} + c \frac{M_s}{a} \frac{dH}{dt} L'(Q)}{1 - c \alpha \frac{M_s}{a} L'(Q)}
    \label{eq:dmdt}
\end{equation}
%
where $Q = \frac{H + \alpha M}{a}$, and

\begin{equation}
    L'(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} - \coth^2(x) + 1
\end{equation}
%
Note that \cref{eq:dmdt} can also be written in the general form for non-linear
Ordinary Differential Equations:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dM}{dt} = f(t,M,\vec{u})
\end{equation}
where $\vec{u} = \begin{bmatrix}
    H \\
    \dot{H}
    \end{bmatrix}$.
\newline\newline
Using the trapezoidal rule for derivative approximation, we find:

\begin{equation}
    \dot{\hat{H}}(n) = 2\frac{\hat{H}(n) - \hat{H}(n-1)}{T} - \dot{\hat{H}}(n-1)
    \label{eq:hDeriv}
\end{equation}
%
We can use the Runge-Kutta 4th-order method \cite{Yeh} to find an explicit solution
for $\hat{M}(n)$:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    k_1 &= T f \Big(n-1, \hat{M}(n-1), \hat{\vec{u}}(n-1) \Big)\\
    k_2 &= T f \Big(n - \frac{1}{2}, \hat{M}(n-1) + \frac{k_1}{2}, \hat{\vec{u}}  \Big(n-\frac{1}{2} \Big) \Big)\\
    k_3 &= T f \Big(n- \frac{1}{2}, \hat{M}(n-1) + \frac{k_2}{2}, \hat{\vec{u}} \Big(n-\frac{1}{2} \Big) \Big)\\
    k_4 &= T f \Big(n, \hat{M}(n-1) + k_3, \hat{\vec{u}}(n) \Big)\\
    \hat{M}(n) &= \hat{M}(n-1) + \frac{k_1}{6} + \frac{k_2}{3} + \frac{k_3}{3} + \frac{k_4}{6}
    \label{eq:Mn}
\end{split}
\end{align}
%
We use linear interpolation to find the half-sample values used to calculate $k_2$ and $k_3$.

\subsubsection{Numerical Considerations} \label{numerical}
To account for rounding errors in the Langevin function for values close to 
zero, we use the following approximation about zero, as in \cite{Hysteresis}:
\begin{equation}
    L(x) = \begin{cases}
        \coth(x) - \frac{1}{x} & \text{for $|x| > 10^{-4}$} \\
        \frac{x}{3} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    L'(x) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{x^2} - \coth^{2}(x) + 1 & \text{for $|x| > 10^{-4}$} \\
        \frac{1}{3} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
Additionally, $\tanh(x)$, and by extension $\coth(x)$ is a
rather computationally expensive operation. With this in mind,
for real-time implementation, we approximate $\coth(x)$ as the
reciprocal of a Gaussian continued fraction for $\tanh(x)$
\cite{MATH}, namely
\begin{equation}
    \tanh(x) = \frac{x}{1 + \frac{x^2}{3 + \frac{x^2}{5 + \frac{x^2}{7}}}}
    \label{eq:continuedFrac}
\end{equation}

    \includegraphics[width=3in]{../Simulations/Hysteresis/Sim2-M_H.png}
    \caption{\label{HysteresisSim}{\it Digitized Hysteresis Loop Simulation}}
\end{figure}
%
\subsubsection{Simulation}
The digitized hysteresis loop was implemented and tested offline
in \texttt{Python}, using the constants $M_s$, $a$, $\alpha$, $k$,
and $c$ from \cite{JilesAtherton1986}. For a sinusoidal input signal
with frequency 2kHz, and varying amplitude from 800 - 2000 Amperes per
meter, \cref{HysteresisSim} shows the Magnetisation output.

\subsection{Play Head}
By combining \cref{eq:Vx} with \cref{eq12,eq15}, we get:
\begin{equation}
    V(t) =  NWEv \mu_0  g M(t)
\end{equation}
%
or,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{V}(n) =  NWEv \mu_0  g \hat{M}(n)
    \label{eq:Vout}
\end{equation}
%
\subsubsection{Loss Effects}
In the real-time system, we model the playhead
loss effects with an FIR filter, derived by
taking the inverse DFT of the
loss effects described in \cref{eq:lossEffects}.
It is worth noting that as in \cref{eq:wavenumber},
the loss effects, and therefore the FIR filter
are dependent on the tape speed.
\newline\newline
The loss effects filter was implemented and
tested offline in \texttt{Python} with tape-head 
spacing of 20 microns, head gap width of 5 microns, 
tape thickness of 35 microns, and tape speed of 15 ips.
The following plot shows the results of the simulation,
with a filter order of 100.

\section{Tape and Tape Machine Parameters}
In the following sections, we describe the implementation of
a real-time model of a Sony TC-260 tape machine, while attempting
to preserve generality so that the process can be repeated for any
other similar reel-to-reel tape machine.

\subsection {Tape Parameters}
A typical reel-to-reel tape such as the Sony TC-260 uses 
Ferric Oxide ($\gamma F_2O_3$) magnetic tape. The following
properties of the tape are necessary for the tape hysteresis
process \cref{eq:dmdt}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Magnetic Saturation ($M_s$): For Ferric Oxide tape
the magnetic saturation is $3.5e5$ (A/m) \cite{jilesBook}
\item Hysteresis Loop Width ($k$): For soft materials, $k$ can be approximated
as the coercivity, $H_c$ \cite{Jiles1992}. For Ferric Oxide, $H_c$ is approximately
$27$ kA/m \cite{jilesBook}.
\item Anhysteric magnetisataion ($a$): Knowing the coercivity and remnance magnetism of Ferric Oxide
\cite{jilesBook}, we can calculate $a$ = 22  kA/m by the method described in
\cite{Jiles1992}
\item Ratio of normal and hysteris initial susceptibilities ($c$): From \cite{Jiles1992}, $c$ = 1.7e-1.
\item Mean field parameter ($\alpha$): From \cite{Jiles1992}, $\alpha$ = 1.6e-3
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tape Machine Parameters}
\subsubsection {Record Head}
To determine the magnetic field output of the
record head using \cref{eq:Hin}, the following parameters 
are necessary:
\begin{itemize}
\item Input Current ($\hat{I} (n)$): For the Sony TC-260
the input current to the record head is approximately
0.1 mA peak-to-peak \cite{RefManual}.
\item Gap Width ($g$): The gap width for recording heads
can range from 2.5 to 12 microns \cite{Kadis}.
\item Turns of wire ($N$): The number of turns of wire
is typically on the order of 100 \cite{1994tmr..book.....B}.
\item Head Efficiency ($E$): The head efficiency is typically
on the order of 0.1 \cite{1994tmr..book.....B}.
\end{itemize}
%
These values result in a peak-to-peak magnetic field
of approximately 5e5 A/m.

\subsubsection{Play Head}
Similar to the record head, the following parameters
are needed to calculate the output voltage using
\cref{eq:Vout,eq:lossEffects} (note that values are only included
here if notably different from the record head):
\begin{itemize}
\item Gap Width ($g$): The play head gap width ranges from
1.5 to 6 microns\cite{Kadis}.
\item Head Width ($W$): For the Sony TC-260, the play head
width is 0.125 inches (note that this is the same as the
width of one track on the quarter-inch tape used by the 
machine) \cite{RefManual}.
\item Tape Speed ($v$): The Sony TC-260 can run at 3.75 inches
per second (ips), or 7.5 ips \cite{RefManual}. Note that many
 tape machines can run at 15 or 32 ips \cite{Kadis}.
\item Tape Thickness ($\delta$): Typical tape that would be used
with the TC-260 is on the order of 35 microns thick \cite{RefManual}.
\item Spacing ($d$): The spacing between the tape and the play
head is highly variable between tape machines. For a typical
tape machine spacing can be as high as 20 microns \cite{Kadis}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \center
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{../Simulations/Bias/BiasEx.png}
    \caption{\label{Bias}{\it Example of a biased signal}}
\end{figure}
%
\subsection{Tape Bias}
A typical analog recorder adds a high-frequency "bias"
current to the signal to avoid the "deadzone" effect when the input signal
crosses zero, as well as to linearize the output. The input
current to the record head can be given by
\cite{Camras:1987:MRH:27189}:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{I}_{head}(n) = \hat{I}_{in}(n) + B \cos(2 \pi f_{bias} n T)
\end{equation}
%
Where the amplitude of the bias current $B$ is usually
about one order of magnitude larger than the input,
and the bias frequency $f_{bias}$ is well above the
audible range. \Cref{Bias} shows a unit-amplitude,
2 kHz sine wave biased by a 50 kHz sine wave with amplitude 5.
To recover the correct output signal, tape machines use a
lowpass filter, with a cutoff frequency well below the bias
frequency, thought still above the audible range \cite{Kadis}.
\newline\newline
For the Sony TC-260, the bias frequency is 55 kHz, with a gain
of 5 relative to the input signal. The lowpass filter used to recover
the audible signal has a cutoff at 24 kHz, though note that due to
the frequency response of the playhead loss effects, the effects
of this filter may be essentially neglible to the real time system.
\cite{RefManual}

\subsection{Wow and Flutter}
Each tape machine has characteristic timing imperfections
known as ``wow'' and/or ``flutter.'' These imperfections
are caused by minor changes in speed from the motors
driving the tape reels, and can cause fluctuations in
the pitch of the output signal. To characterize these
timing imperfections, we use a method similar to \cite{tapeDelay}:
We recorded a pulse train of 1000 pulses through a TC-260,
then recorded the pulses back from the tape. \Cref{timingSim}
shows a section of a superimposed plot of the original
pulse train against the pulse train recorded from the tape
machine. From this data, we were able to generate a periodic
function that accurately models the timing imperfections of
the TC-260. The process was performed at both 7.5 ips and 3.75
ips. In the real-time system, the timing imperfection model
is used to inform a modulating delay line, to achieve the
signature "wow" effect of an analog tape machine.

\section{Real-Time Implementation}
We implemented our physical model of the Sony TC-260 as a
VST audio plugin using the JUCE framework. \Cref{flowchart}
shows the signal flow of the system in detail. We allow the user
to control parameters in real-time including the tape speed, bias gain, gap
width, tape thickness, tape spacing, and flutter depth. 
C/C++ code for the real-time implementation is open-source
and is available on GitHub
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel}}.

\subsection{Oversampling}
If no oversampling is used, the system will be unstable
for input signal at the Nyquist frequency, due to limitations
of the trapezoid rule derivate approximation used in \cref{eq:hDeriv}.
To avoid this instability, early versions of the real-time
implementation used a lowpass filter with cutoff frequency
just below Nyquist. However, due to aliasing caused by the
nonlinearity of the tape hysteresis model, oversampling is
necessary to mitigate aliasing artifacts \cite{Yeh}. Further,
the system must be able to faithfully recreate not only the
frequencies in the audible range but the bias frequency as
well. Since the TC-260 uses a bias frequency of 55 kHz \cite{RefManual}
and the minimum standard audio sampling rate is 44.1 kHz,
a minimum oversampling factor of 3x is required. However,
since the biased signal is then fed into the hystersis model,
even more oversampling is required to avoid aliasing. With these
considerations in mind, our system uses an oversampling
factor of 16x.

% \subsection{Performance}
% At 16x oversampling, even with the various numerical optimizations
% described in \Cref{numerical}, the CPU load is fairly high.

\subsection{Results}
In subjective testing, our physical model sounds quite convincing,
with warm, tape-like distortion, and realistic sounding
flutter. The high-frequency loss and low-frequency
``head bump'' change correctly at different tape speeds,
and are approximately within the frequency response
specifications of the TC-260 service manual \cite{RefManual}.
The distortion and frequency response characteristics
of our model are subjectively very close when compared to
the output of an actual TC-260, though not nearly close enough to 
``fool'' the listener. Additionally, as the bias
gain is lowered, the ``deadzone'' effect appears exactly
as expected \cite{Camras:1987:MRH:27189}.
The largest difference between the model and the physical
machine is the subtle electrical and mechanical noises
and dropouts present in the physical machine, presumably
caused by the age and wear-and-tear of the machine, which
we did not attempt to characterize in our model.
\Cref{tests} shows the results
of tests performed on the real-time system. In particular,
note the successfully modelled hysteresis function (left),
the ``deadzone'' effect (center), and the timing imperfections
or flutter (right). Audio examples from the real-time
system can be found online\footnote{\url{https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jatin/420/tape/}}.

\section{Future Improvements}
\subsection{Spatial Magnetic Effects}
The most obvious improvement to be made for the physical model
is the inclusion of spatial effects of the tape. In particular,
the approximations made in \cref{eq:spatialApprox}, negate any
effects caused by magnetisation along the longitudinal length
of the tape, and into the depth of the tape. Including spatial
effects would involve deriving digital analogues for
\cref{eq:H_x,eq:H_y,eq:Vx}, and re-deriving \cref{eq:Mn}
to take an 2-dimensional magnetic field input at every timestep,
rather than the zero-dimensional input it currently takes. This change
would greatly increase the computational complexity of the system.
At an oversampling rate of 16x,
using just 100 spatial samples would be 1600x more
computationally complex than the current system.
