CHOW Tape Model is a physical model of an analog tape machine,
implemented as an audio plugin. The physical model is described
in a [paper](http://dafx2019.bcu.ac.uk/papers/DAFx2019_paper_3.pdf)
presented at the 2019 DAFx conference. This work began part of a
class project for [Music 420](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/420/)
at Stanford University (CCRMA).
