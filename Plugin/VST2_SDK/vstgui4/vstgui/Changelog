	* fixed some bugs introduced with the platform abstraction
	* added color chooser view (and panel for uidescription)
	* replaced NAMESPACES makros with namespace VSTGUI

2009-11-20 arne

	* completed platform abstraction (except the CVSTGUITimer class)
	* eliminated the following macros : VSTGUI_USES_COREGRAPHICS, GDIPLUS, VSTGUI_USES_UTF8 and VSTGUI_FLOAT_COORDINATES
		this means:
		- On Windows VSTGUI now only uses GDI+ as the drawing API
		- CCoord is of type double
		- The text drawing methods expects the strings to be in UTF-8 not ASCII

	* because of the changes above, many classes have some changes, here are the most prominent
		- CBitmap only has one draw method which actually calls thru to CDrawContext.
		- CBitmap transparency is gone. Use PNG Bitmaps with an alpha channel to get the same result.
		- COffscreenContext must be created via the static create method.

	* the concept behind the platform abstraction is that the platform frame implementation 
	  is responsible to create nearly all the necessary platform objects except bitmaps and fonts for now (this may be the next step).
	  this way it should be easier to maintain the source and much easier to add more platform implementations.

	* added method CViewContainer::addView (CView *pView, CView* pBefore) to place a view before another view in the internal list.
	* added method CRect::unite (const CRect& rect) to unite two rects.
	* added resizing to view attributes

	* Implemented Offscreen stuff on Mac OS X without the need of quickdraw (and fix Offscreen drawing on mac with and without quickdraw)
	* In CTextEdit::looseFocus changed order of loose focus message handling and valueChanged notification so that you can call takeFocus in valueChanged or destroy the textedit control in there.

2006-05-10 arne

	* quartz: moved CBitmap completly to Image I/O in Mac OS X >= 10.4. The downside is, that you can only set the transparent color once.
	* CBitmap::setTransparentColor needs to be called explicilty now. The default behaviour is now that there's no transparent color initially.
	* removed BEOS code
	* when changeing the size of the container in CScrollView another parameter controls if the visible area should stay the same.
	* new working implementation of CSplashScreen

	* reorganized GDI+ initialization

2005-12-11 arne

	* moved mouse methods from CDrawContext to CFrame where it makes sense
	* added kDoubleClick to button state, so that you don't need the old way to call waitDoubleClick
	* more GDI+ stuff (it's much faster now)
	* removed tooltip handling
	* added mouse observer interface to CFrame (tooltips could be handled this way in a more generic fashion, see the CTooltipSupport class)
	* renamed CReferenceCounter to CBaseObject and moved the notify method to it
	* reorganized doxygen documentation
	* changed implementation of CView::attached and CView::removed. If you overwrite them, always call the super class implementation also. 
		And because of this and the way modal views are handled CSplashScreen needs to be rewritten (not done yet).
	* added check for unreleased CViews when DEBUG is set

2005-11-22 arne

	* new handling of deprecated methods (on mac osx with gcc you get a warning now when using these methods)
	* declared more methods as deprecated
	* per default deprecated methods are compiled in, you can change this with the macro VSTGUI_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_METHODS=0
	* initial support for Unicode (using UTF8 at the moment)
	* added CView::parentSizeChanged() and CView::getVisibleSize()
	* fix some mouse wheel coordinate errors
	* fix problems with ENABLE_VST_EXTENSION_IN_VSTGUI
	
2005-09-23 arne

	* proper handling of attached and removed calls of CView (if you overwrite them, always call its parents implementation)
	* mac: working again with non composited windows
	* CScrollView uses proper stepping algo (at least if the mac implementation is considered as proper ;-)

2005-09-21 arne

	* mac: make it compatible again with Mac OS X < 10.4
	* mac: complete new mouse handling
	* adding CVSTGUITimer class, currently needed in CScrollView
	* win: added new mouse handling
	* win: first GDI+ stuff (oh it's slow, slow, slow ... needs much work I guess)

2005-09-08 arne

	* added some kind of tooltip support
		- if the mouse comes over a view which has a kCViewTooltipAttribute, the tooltip view, which can be set on the frame, is changed to the string in the attribute
	* fix some stuff with the new mouse handling
	
2005-09-02 arne

	* added new interface class for communicating stuff between CFrame and Editor : VSTGUIEditorInterface.
	* because of this the macro PLUGGUI is obsolete and removed.
	* specific VST stuff is now enclosed by ENABLE_VST_EXTENSION_IN_VSTGUI like the CFileSelector stuff, where the host is asked about showing a File Chooser. If you need it, define it and set it to 1.
	* AEffGUIEditor is now subclassed from AEffEditor and VSTGUIEditorInterface (the most common compiler error now is, that you need to include "aeffguieditor.h" in your editor class header)

2005-08-31 arne

	* new mouse handling (onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onMouseMoved, onMouseEntered, onMouseExited)
	  but the old mouse method is still working, if the new methods are not implemented by the super class
	* drawing is now triggered by system events, so drawing outside of the draw method is deprecated

		This means :
	  	- all class methods which took a CDrawContext pointer will be changed except the draw methods.
	  	- you call view->invalid () instead of view->setDirty (true) from the User Interface thread.
	  	- value changes from other threads will be checked on idle and the views are marked invalid.

		Benefits :
		- less hacks
		- less code
		- cleaner differentiation of drawing and user action.
		- works better with hosts which don't follow the VST spec.

	* added controlBeginEdit and controlEndEdit to CControlListener

2005-08-22 arne

	* branched for 3.0 (vstgui_300)
	* removed all MOTIF code

**********************************************************************************************************************
VSTGUI 3.0 branch
**********************************************************************************************************************

2005-08-12 arne

	* initial support for X/Y mouse wheel (currently only macosx, don't know how ms windows handles this)
	
2005-07-29 arne

	* bugfix: CDrawContext doesn't remember font style and does not change the font if only the font style changed.
	* quartz: keyboard event handling works now, so that hosts will get all key events we don't handle.
	
2005-07-22 arne

	* quartz: little optimization in CDrawContext::beginCGContext
	* quartz: cleaned up the event handler
	* stop advancing focus if the last focusable control has focus.

2005-07-22 arne

	* moved CFileSelector in its own file
	* quartz: fixed some bugs with COffscreenContext

2005-07-09 arne

	* bug fix for overlapping control drawing.
	* add a style to COnOffButton so that the listener can be called before doIdleStuff is called.

2005-07-02 arne

	* windows: CFrame uses a backbuffer now when USE_ALPHA_BLEND is on. This fixes a performance issue with some graphic cards.
				The drawback at the moment is, that drawing can only occur when the CFrame calls the views to draw. You can not draw anymore
				by creating your own drawcontext.

2005-06-25 arne

	* adding keyboard focus navigation
	* add bool bWantsFocus to CView. If this is set the view is included in keyboard focus navigation.

2005-06-24 arne

	* merge newframe back to main

2005-04-30 arne

	* windows: with libpng, when a bmp image was loaded, don't use AlphaBlend instead use old BitBlt.
	* quartz: non png images can be drawn with transparent color again.

2005-04-29 arne

	* added CTextLabel
	* mac: the CFrame can be placed into HIScrollViews
	* mac: using static objects for Quicktime GraphicsImporter to speed up loading of images
	* mac: using CGImageCreateImageInRect on 10.4 for faster drawing of clipped images

	* a try to fix redraw problems if the system sends a redraw and some views won't get updated completly
	* changed the implementation of CView Attributes. Documentation removed. Will be updated before the 3.0 release.

2005-03-05 arne

	* small bugfix in CDrawDevice::drawRect
	
2005-01-04 arne

	* the following CDrawContext methods have a new optional parameter "CDrawStyle": drawPolygon, drawRect, drawArc, drawEllipse.
	  the draw style is either kDrawStroked, kDrawFilled or kDrawFilledAndStroked.
	* added another cursor : kCursorHand
	* fixed some problems compiling the code on microsoft windows.
	* fixed some problems with alphablending bitmaps on windows.
	* added example plugguieditor.cpp file to be used for non VST usage. (There's an example AU plug in the drawtest module)
	* added CTabView class.
	* changed constructor of AEffGUIEditor to take a void instead of an AudioEffect pointer, so that subclassing 
	  either from PluginGUIEditor or AEffGUIEditor is as simple as possible.

2004-11-29 arne

	* started to clean up the code (check your code, many methods in CView, CViewContainer & CFrame are declared const now)
	* started to make a better documentation (see the headers), more to come
	* renamed pEditView in CFrame to pFocusView as well as setEditView to setFocusView and getEditView to getFocusView ;-)
	* the following methods in CView are now deprecated : setParentView, setFrame, getFrameTopLeftPos

	* bugfix for CViewContainer::getCurrentView (). Didn't work for nested containers (W.Franke)
	* quartz: CFrame::getSize returns the size of the mac control now instead of the window
	* CViewContainer::getViewAt changed so that you can get the deepest view at that position
	* CControls set now the editView of the frame on beginEdit and set it to zero at endEdit (W.Franke)
	
2004-08-30 arne

	**** bump version to 3.0 !
	
	* change CView::getParent to CView::getFrame
	* correct implementation of beginEdit and endEdit in all CControls, you should change your code of custom controls from getParent->beginEdit (tag) to beginEdit () ;-)
	* new drawArc method in CDrawContext which takes angels as parameters
	* added some kind of runtime type information.
	* mac: changed the kInfinitySymbol to be 'oo' as the mac character is not available in Helvetica
	* added two new cursor types (kCursorCopy & kCursorNotAllowed). (Currently only for Mac OS X, Windows will follow)

	* some fixes to the update methods when drawing with offsets and COffscreenContexts.
	* mac: the macro 'CARBON' is changed to 'TARGET_API_MAC_CARBON' as this is what the Mac OS itself uses.
	* mac: compiling with VSTGUI as namespace works now
	* mac: use current API for creating menus. (fixes some bugs with the old implementation, where you could not create menuitems like "-3db")
	
2004-08-25 arne

	* mac: change COptionMenuScheme implementation to be optional as it only works for OSX Version >= 10.3 (macro: MAC_ENABLE_MENU_SCHEME)

2004-08-15 arne

	* added CView::acceptDrop. On Mac OS this changes the mouse cursor if a view accepts a drop. For Windows there is currently no action. But it should follow. And maybe it will change so that a real tracking is possible.
	* with the new update mechanism the modal view is now updated first in CFrame::update, to make sure it will be drawn in all circumstances, even if it is transparent and a view below it is dirty.

2004-08-06 arne

	* quartz:	- cache the CGImageRef, so that it is not created every time the CBitmap is drawn. (Performace will be much better with the next os release)
				- remove the SetPort/GetPort stuff in AEffGUIEditor. It is not needed anymore.

2004-07-30 arne

	* better streamlined mechanism for CViewContainer::update (you can turn this off, if it does not work for you in vstgui.cpp with the NEW_UPDATE_MECHANISM macro at the top)
	  	this is not tested with Containers using offscreens (but should work). This should fix the problem that non-transparent containers were not really nestable.
	* quartz: removed the focus handlers for now as most hosts does not set the focus back on their windows if someone clicks into it. This way they get all key downs again.

	* quartz: fix a bug in COffscreenContext::copyTo if the offsetScreen point of the context is not at 0:0

2004-06-28 arne

	* quartz: fix clipping issues
	* fix a bug in CViewContainer's update method if the container is transparent and embedded into another CViewContainer

2004-06-26 arne

	* the modal view is now added to the frame like all other views.
	* added a reference counting class. CView, CBitmap and CDrawContext are subclasses of it.
	* clip handling is more consistent now.
	* some quartz changes:	- first try to implement CDrawDevice::drawArc (not yet finished)
							- COffscreenContext is now more implemented, copyTo works in most situations
							- native mac controls can now be embedded into the frame, but it does only work correct with compositing enabled windows

	* AEffGUIEditor::draw will now draw only the rectangle it should, or as in the past the whole editor if no rect is given.
	* windows: 64 bit compatibility

2004-06-12 arne

	* CFrame is now subclassed from CViewContainer (thanks Wolfram Franke for the hard work)
	  - One thing to check: CFrame::removeView was declared with (CView *pView, const bool &withForget = false), this has changed to 
	    (CView *pView, const bool &withForget = true). So if you have somewhere in your Code frame->removeView (view) you must change it
	    to frame->removeView (view, false).
	* mac: FDebugPrint implementation for Classic and Mac OS X
	* changed the CColor unused member variable to be alpha all over the place (no more MS C++ internal compiler error)
	* macosx: the CFileSelector can now be used to get unix path strings. If vstFileSelect->future[0] is 1 the internal implementation will 
				return unix paths and set vstFileSelect->future[0] to 0. If the host supports openFileSelector vstFileSelect->future[0] will
				be 1 and the results are in the old FSSpec format.
	* the CFileSelector is now usable when PLUGGUI is set.
	* using clipping all over the place
	* quartz: rechecked the whole graphics drawing functions to work as expected

	* mac: COptionMenuScheme works now with QUARTZ (Mac OS X 10.3 and above)
	* mac: QUARTZ implementation of CDrawContext::drawEllipse and fillEllipse 
	* added a global COptionMenuScheme variable, if set all menues will use it
	* fix a possible crash in COptionMenu::mouse (thanks Wolfram Franke)

2004-05-22 arne

	* moved pBackgroundBitmap and its accessors into CView from CViewContainer, CFrame and CControl as suggested by Wolfram Franke
	* mac: added implementation for quartz CBitmap::CBitmap (CFrame &frame, long width, long height) 
	* windows: prevent a free memory read in UDropTarget::Release (submitted by Justin Caldicott)

2004-04-27 arne

	* changed CControlListener and added a method to intercept modifier clicks so the listener can decide if the control should handle
	  this click. This makes it easy to implement some kind of 'MIDI Learn' functionality.
	  Note: you need to implement this new method in your CControlListener, otherwise there will be compile errors. If you don't want 
	        this feature, just return 0.
	* changed all controls to support the new CControlListener method.
	* mac: bugfix for CTextEdit::takeFocus under quartz.
	* mac: changed fonts from arial to helvetica as on some OS X installations arial is not installed.
	
2004-04-17 arne

	* windows: support for alpha blended images like it is on Mac OS X with quartz
		   note: this implementation uses libpng (macro is USE_LIBPNG)
	* CDrawContext::setClipRect uses the offset now
	* COptionMenu::getSubMenu added
	* mac: fixed some quartz drawing stuff
	* mac: fix for CFrame::getPosition with quartz
	* mac: removed CARBON_EVENTS macro as it only works with QUARTZ
	
2004-04-11 arne
	
	* CViewContainer should be completely nestable now
	* mac: implemented the quartz offscreencontext for existing bitmaps
	
2004-03-23 arne

	* CTextEdit use the CParamDisplay::stringConvert functions to draw text
	* Fix of possible crash in CFileSelector::run
	* CFM Carbon plugs can now draw text antialiased even if the host does not support it
	(Thanks to Wolfram Franke for this stuff)

	* mac: added waitDoubleClick and waitDrag with carbon events

2004-03-19 arne

	* add CView::getFrameTopLeftPos method to get the topleft position of the view relative to the frame
	* call AEffGUIEditor instead of AudioEffectX for beginEdit and endEdit
	* mac: small changes to allow to use a CDrawContext on every Window even those without a CFrame

	* fix a typo in COptionMenu::mouse
	* mac: fix a typo in CDrawContext::setLineStyle
	* mac: fix for CDrawContext::getMouseLocation problem with DP 4
	* mac: on compositing windows the control is now added to the kHIViewWindowContentID if it exists.
	* mac: should compile on Mac OS X 10.2 again if CARBON_EVENTS are defined.

	* fix compile problem of COptionMenu::takeFocus on Windows

2003-12-04 arne

	* fix for nested CViewContainers
	* Mac: fix for using vstgui for other than VST ;-)

2003-11-15 arne

	***************
	*** WARNING ***
	***************
	existing code need to be changed !!!
	You need to change your CView::mouse methods to add the buttons parameter and your calls to CDrawContext::getMouseLocation inside CViews should be changed to call CView::getMouseLocation instead.
	***************
	
	* fixed the CViewContainer stuff with Quartz.
		NOTE :	I had to change the way how the view can get the current mouse location. It has to ask itself now as the CView class can 
				check if it is embedded into a CViewContainer which the CDrawDevice couldn't.
	* all mouse methods get another parameter: long buttons

	Mac Only:
	* changed the drag and drop stuff for Carbon Events
	* With CARBON_EVENTS == 1, CFrame acts now like a Mac Toolbox Control. It works even on compositing enabled windows and on non left-top positions.

	* Bugfix for COptionMenu::addEntry submitted by Nicolas Bronnec

2003-09-18 arne

	* incorporated Marc Poirier's CTextEdit fixes
	* quartz: bugfix in drawString, set cliprect so that the text won't draw outside
	* carbon events: some code cleanup

2003-09-17 arne

	* Added Carbon Events handling (#define CARBON_EVENTS 1)
	* Implemented QUARTZ drawing. (#define QUARTZ 1)
	* CSlider doesn't use a COffscreenContext for drawing on MacOSX anymore

	Quartz Notes:
		- Not all graphic operations we use in vstgui have an equivalent in quartz.
			Currently unsupported are : 
				- all drawing modes except kCopyMode
				- getPoint ()
				_ floodFill ()
				- copy from Screen to Offscreen

		- to support alpha drawing on all operations I have made changes to CColor. The 4th variable is now the alpha value where 255 is opaque and 0 is transparent.
		- transparent bitmap drawing is now handled with the alpha value of the bitmap, if you want the old behaviour turn on OLD_TRANSPARENT_BITMAP_MODE
		- because of some strange things with CViewContainers while doing mouse downs the drawcontext has an offset which results in wrong drawing. This needs to be fixed !!!
